    <p>About Me</p>
    <p>I am taking this class to satisfy my degree plan where I need enough CIT credits to graduate.
        However, I do enjoy building websites because it is a fun creative outlet that allows you to style website in your 
        own taste while delivering satisfying challenge. I originally wanted to be a website designer but now I want to focus
         on the security side more because I feel like I can help more people. 
        Nevertheless, I'm sure this class will develop my understanding in creating a secure website. 
    </p>
    <p>What I hope to achieve in this class:</p>
    <div class="parent">
        <ul>
            <li>Score above a 90%.</li>
            <li>Make new friends.</li>
            <li>Learn a new skill.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
